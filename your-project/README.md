## Project Description
This project consists of a simplified simulation of the game Blackjack. It consists of a 1 vs. 1 version in which the player (user) plays against the dealer (CPU).
## Rules
The blackjack rules included in this simulation are the following:
- **Card values**: It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.
- **Betting**: The player chooses an initial amount of money with which he wants to play. In each round, he/she must decide how much he/she wants to bet. The game ends when the player runs out of money or  when he/she decides to bet 0 in a specific round.
- **The deal**: When a round starts, the dealer gives two faced up cards to the player and two cards to the dealer: one faced up and the other one faced down.
- **Blackjack**: If the player has a blackjack, the dealer’s faced down card is faced up. If the dealer has a blackjack, it is a tie. If not, the player wins and collects double of its bet.
- **Player’s play**: if the player does not have a blackjack, he/she can decide if the wants another card (“Hit”) or no more cards (“Stand”) as long as its total score is under or equal to 21. If he/she goes “bust” (over 21) he/she loses automatically.  If the player stands under 21, it is the dealer’s turn.
- **Dealer’s play**: the dealer’s play is automatic. The dealer must “Hit” if its score is under or equal to 16 and must “Stand” if its score is equal or greater than 17.
